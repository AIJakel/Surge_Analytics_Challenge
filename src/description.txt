Task:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

In around 2-4 hours, you need to write a single page application, to support a Point Of Sales terminal. The Terminal will be used by cashiers to enter sales orders and check order total. Cashiers might be using Mobile / Tablet / Desktop. You can choose any UI framework. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

The application consists of 2 widgets:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Sales orders entry widget.​
Credit check widget.​


Sales order entry widget​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​:
Within - Cashier puts “product name”, “price”, “qty”. It shows all entered lines and calculates totals.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Credit check widget​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​:
The widget will be used to check the maximum order amount. Cashier puts the maximum amount (credit limit). If the currently entered order total less than the credit limit, the “indicator box” is green, otherwise - the “indicator box” will be blinking with red.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
It will be nice to save “credit limit” across sessions.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

While developing widgets please consider that in the future those widgets may be used independently from each other, or may be placed on the same page, different pages or some of them may not be used.
